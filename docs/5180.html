Energy will move on from beads, rocks, and seashells to find something else which is stronger, and more fit to withstand the threat of outside entities trying to produce more and flood the market with. Over time, it had become evident that monetary energy had chosen gold as the best choice on a global scale for any region that had access to it. The reason why gold has been able to hold its value over the course of thousands of years is due to its virtually indestructible properties, as well as it being a resource that is difficult to produce more of on an international level versus a regional level. Gold is relatively scarce in the sense that only about 2% of gold is able to be mined every year and introduced into the market, making the threat of a supply flood nearly impossible. However, with a 2% yearly increase, gold is not thermodynamically sound and although there is no real threat of a flood, there is still a leak that cannot be plugged up.<br/> <br/> Gold allowed societies to flourish under a hard money whose store of value properties were able to protect the monetary energy and purchasing power of gold holders centuries into the future. Having a money whose value increases or maintains its purchasing power over time rather than a money whose value decreases allows human beings to have peace of mind regarding their future. It is why many governments and nation-states eventually adopted what is known as the Gold Standard. Before going any further though, it is important to understand some of the main properties needed to not only be an efficient store of value, but a functioning medium of exchange.<br/> <br/> An effective money (sound money) should be easily divisible, portable, durable, homogenous, and it should be scarce. Two of the big issues with gold revolve around the aspects of divisibility and portability. It is difficult for the average person to divide gold into smaller parts, and size and weight pose issues with the portability of gold. Many societies combatted these issues with the production of gold coins, which unfortunately often led to coin clipping and debasement of the coins from centralized authorities (see Byzantine gold coins for example). Although gold was effective in transacting value across time, it was not as effective in transacting value across space. Eventually, at the end of the 19th century, many governments decided to peg paper bank notes to gold. The bank notes in a sense acted as redeemable receipts for gold where you could, for example, at any time walk into a bank and redeem your dollar bill for 1/35th of an ounce of gold. The bank notes played a helpful role in increasing the ease of gold’s portability and divisibility by expressing the value as a lightweight piece of paper with different value increments. Although the Gold Standard was effective while it lasted and provided a period of stabilized monetary energy conservation, gold was eventually centralized and many countries trusted the USA to safeguard their gold reserves and uphold the dollar to gold ratio. A mixture of political and economic pressures on a global scale ultimately led to the US failing at this and abandoning the gold standard in 1971. <br/> <br/> The abandonment of the Gold Standard issued in a new era of monetary policy which, referred to by Saifedean Ammous, can be better known as the Fiat Standard. The Fiat Standard is a monetary policy that enables the exterior forces mentioned earlier to mint their new money and inject it into the circulating supply, while simultaneously stealing monetary energy from anyone unable to play by the same rules as them. This fiat money is not backed by the energy storage properties of gold, but by trust in the government to maintain social and economic order and influence to stabilize and store the value. It is no coincidence that since the Vietnam War and Nixon’s decision to break off the Gold Standard, trust in the US government by its citizens has been on a consistent downtrend.<br/> <br/> In a world where the state controls the money, it puts its citizens at a clear disadvantage since it is illegal for citizens to print money. Having institutions in place designed to monitor inflation and control government printing and spending have proved pointless as the US now faces roughly $30,000,000,000,000 worth of debt with no sign of putting a stop to their ongoing debasement of their peoples’ energy and purchasing power. After the 2008 financial crisis when the US government decided to not hold the banks accountable for their part in the mess, but instead bail them out with stimulus packages, it was clear that this age of government issued money needed a solution. A solution to this problem of time and energy theft by the governments across the world was posed by a pseudonymous coder who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto and went live in the following year.</p><figure class="ka kb kc kd fq iu fe ff paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="iv iw di ix bf iy"><div class="fe ff ki"><img src="../Images/bb4d3b3a457c309be93fb5d488796c8f.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pSWyRFUuO1HtiVOFhsFeYw.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="ke kf fg fe ff kg kh bd b be z ek">The chart of a government unable to resist the temptations of printing of fiat.</figcaption></figure><p id="b2ad" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jb jc ht jd b je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy hm dt translated">这个解决方案叫做比特币。比特币是第一个工程化的热力学货币系统，旨在存储跨时间和空间的货币能量。凭借2100万比特币(稀缺)的硬上限供应(可以被分解为2.1万亿个被称为satoshis(可分)的单位)，以及由任何个人或实体都无法改变或篡改的不可变代码管理的货币政策，中本聪能够利用多年的计算机科学和奥地利经济思想解决这个破碎的系统。由于比特币协议是去中心化的，因此不存在单一的弱点，这使得该协议不可能被黑客攻击(持久)。通过使用比特币闪电网络，可以瞬间将任意数量的比特币传送到世界各地，只需支付微小的费用(便携)。要加入比特币网络，你需要的只是一台可以上网的移动设备或电脑，而且你不需要提供任何个人信息。比特币网络的参与者，尤其是那些生活在独裁统治者和监控国家下的参与者，能够在没有中央实体许可或干预的情况下，在彼此之间进行私下交易。这是一个没有统治者的平等主义规则体系，富人必须遵守与穷人相同的规则，政府必须遵守与人民相同的规则(同质)。<br/> <br/>随着21世纪技术的快速创新，我们通过互联网的诞生见证了信息和通信的数字化和民主化。这也导致了许多其他事物的数字化和民主化。一个例子是音乐；音乐曾经有很高的准入门槛，这经常导致艺术家们争先恐后地将他们的实体混音带拿到他人手中，但他们现在可以录制并立即上传到SoundCloud或Spotify等平台上，数百万人可以在那里看到他们来自世界各地的作品。亚马逊能够将书籍和阅读材料数字化和大众化，现在不需要借书证或附近的书店，你可以在线浏览你最喜欢的书籍，并将整个图书馆下载到你的智能手机或平板电脑上。新冠肺炎的不幸到来也推动了劳动力的数字化和民主化，现在许多行业的员工都能够自由地重新定位，并在组织中获得更多机会，因为像Zoom和微软团队这样的通信技术，他们以前可能由于身体限制而没有机会。作为一个全球社会，我们现在正在向一个货币已经数字化和民主化的世界过渡。我们现在有一个无需许可、防查封、防审查、分散的体系，准入门槛极低，允许一个人对自己的货币能量拥有完全的主权，并容易进入世界经济，而许多人被排除在外。</p><figure class="ka kb kc kd fq iu fe ff paragraph-image"><div class="fe ff kj"><img src="../Images/16f8d2aaff95d658181f7fed913f84a7.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1240/format:webp/1*R0WLRkOw5Ziga9NGCmPRXg.jpeg"/></div><figcaption class="ke kf fg fe ff kg kh bd b be z ek">Crowds gather to try and withdraw money from the bank in Myanmar after the military coup, paralyzing the banking system which was unable to keep up with withdrawals.
